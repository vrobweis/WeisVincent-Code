# C# Notes

## Data Types
* All types in C# are inherited directly or indirectly from System.Object
* Value Types
    * Structs 
    * Enums
    * predefined types (int, long, short, byte, DateTime, char)
* Reference Types
    * Classes
    * Interface
    * Delegates
    * predefined reference types (string, arrays, collections etc.)
* Boxing is converting a value type to a reference type, unboxing is the reverse.


## Semantic code (DRY, Comments-inline, Comments-XML, KISS)





# Day 4





# Day 5

## Design patterns - singleton & factory



## Multithreading (Async/await, Task, Thread)

## Variance (As, Boxing, Casting, Contravariant, Covariant, Invariant, Is, Out, Ref, Typeof)
