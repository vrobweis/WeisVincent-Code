# S.O.L.I.D. Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

## Openâ€“closed principle (OCP)
* "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

## Liskov-substitution principle (LSP)
* "Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program."
* A subclass should be able to replace its parent class.

## Interface segregation principle (ISP)
* Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
* One should "depend upon abstractions, not concretions."
