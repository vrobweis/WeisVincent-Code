## Center of Excellence
- Governs RPA deployment standards, best practices, support and training capabilities inside an organization
- Types
    - Centralized: Single RPA CoE serves all the business units
    - Federated: Independent RPA CoEs within each business unit
    - Hybrid: One main RPA CoE is linked to several smaller RPA CoEs dedicated to business units

## RPA Team
- Developer
- Solution Architect: Defines architecture of the RPA solution and ensures its performance
- Infrastructure Engineer: Maintains and upgrades hardware and software that supports RPA
- Business Analyst: Uses business process expertise to map the processes to be automated
- Project Manager: Ensures that the team generates the desired outcome for their organization
- Technical Lead: Responsible for tactical management of the RPA developers during the development and testing stages
## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1. Planning and Analysis
2. Defining Requirements
3. Designing the Product Architecture
4. Developing the Product
5. Testing the Product
6. Deploying the Product
## RPA Development Lifecycle
- Two different methodologies
    - Waterfall
        - Steps are defined in advange and followed sequentially
        - Success criteria are established at the beginning
        - Each step must finish before the next one can begin
        - Follows 'Plan everything first' approach
    - Agile
        - Process starts with Discovery Sessions to understand the business and RPA
        - Iterative approach
        - Suitable for frequent changes to ensure a prompt response time
1. Analysis
2. Development
3. Testing
4. System Integration Testing
5. User Acceptance Testing
6. Warranty
## Process Standardization
- Consists of establishing rules that govern the way to execute a given task or sequence of tasks.
- The typical areas of standardization are:
    - Predictability in execution
    - Standardization of I/O
    - Reducing the exception rate
## RPA Implementation in business
1. Pilot implementation in small process with little room for error, survey stakeholders for feedback
2. Ramp up
    - Establishing best practices
    - Growing internal automation team and expertise
    - Qualifying additional processes for automation
    - Optimizing management of the virtual workforce
